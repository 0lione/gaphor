Actions, menu items, toolbars and toolboxes
===========================================


 UIManager

 ActionGroup

 Action
   | on_activate
 perform action

 * Where it should lead:
    * Actions should be coded closer to the object their working on
       - main actions - not dependent on GUI components (load/save/new/quit)
       - main actions dependent on GUI component (sub-windows, console)
       - Item actions, act either on a diagram, the selected or focused item
         or no item.
       - diagram actions (zoom, grid) work on active diagram (tab)
       - menus and actions for diagram items through adapters

    * Each window has it's own action group / every item with a menu!
    * One action group for the application/gui_manager
    * One toplevel UIManager per window or one per application/gui_manager?
    ? Actions should inherit from gtk.Action
    ? Actions should be modeled as functions (methods) with action as
      first (sec) parameter.
 * filename should not be part of the main window
 * some sort of factory mechanism.
     - RecentFiles will manage up to 10 recent files entries.
     - same for stereotypes: should be managed by one "ObjectAction".
     - can Placeholders play a role here?
