Actions, menu items, toolbars and toolboxes
===========================================

The GTK+ structure is like this::

    UIManager
        |
   ActionGroup
        |
     Action

The do_activate signal is emitted when an action is activated.

Where it should lead:
 * Actions should be coded closer to the object their working on
    - main actions - not dependent on GUI components (load/save/new/quit)
    - main actions dependent on GUI component (sub-windows, console)
    - Item actions, act either on a diagram, the selected or focused item
      or no item.
    - diagram actions (zoom, grid) work on active diagram (tab)
    - menus and actions for diagram items through adapters
 
 * Actions should behave more like adapters. E.g. when a popup menu is created
   for an Association item, the menu actions should present themselves in the
   context of that menu item (with toggles set right)
    - Could be registered as adapters with a name.

 * Each window has it's own action group (every item with a menu?)
 * One action group for the application/gui_manager (new/load/save/quit)
 * One toplevel UIManager per window or one per application/gui_manager?
 ? Actions should inherit from gtk.Action.
   Depends on the structure. Preferbly not, since it ties actions to GTK+
   (which is not a good thing for testing)
 ? Actions should be modeled as functions (methods) with action as
   first (sec) parameter.
   Normal actions can be modeled as functions. If an action is sensitive or
   visible depends on the state in the action. Hence we require the update()
   method.

 * some sort of factory mechanism (MultiAction?).
    - contains an ActionGroup and menu-XML.
    - RecentFiles will manage up to 10 recent files entries.
    - same for stereotypes: should be managed by one "ObjectAction".
    - can Placeholders play a role here? Yes, they can be used to identify the
      section where the actions should be put.
    - In some cases multiple menu items may refer to the same action:
      radio actions may (but this is not always the case) and the Recent files
      functionality.
