Plugins
-------

Gaphor is growing and the need arises to add optional modules: plugins.

A plugin is loaded on startup of the application (and possibly on demand).

Before a plugin is loaded an xml file is read which contains some definitions
for the plugin:
 - information such as author, version, and of course the name
 - requirements: other plugins this one depends on, modules
 - definitions of Actions
 - Code that should be ran before and after installation, before and after
   removal.
