UML Model
~~~~~~~~~

The UML model that should hold all information. It would be nice if the model
looks like the UML MetaModel. In order to keep the model consistent a lot of
bi-directional relations have to be made. Those relations have a multiplicity
of '0..1', '1', '1..*' or '*'. For simplicity we reduce this to '1' and '*'.

For the objects that have a multiplicity of 1 we can simply assign a
value to the attribute. If a new value is assigned to the value we can simply
replace it.

We also need some sort of Sequence object (a 'list-deluxe') that will allow us
to add and remove elements from the list. We can use the List object for that,
but we should check the object that is added to the list for its type.
