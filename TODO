As always, there is much to do...

- Diagram items should be created for lots of model elements
  (we currently have Actor, UseCase, Comment and the fancy line that connects
   a comment with another model element). First I will focus on some
   relationships (Generatlization and Association), since that will make
   use cases usable. Then we can start with Package and Class items...

- Overall user interface... I have some vague idea how to set it up, but
  I need someone with a little vision to create me a useable UI.

- Exporting diagrams to UML XMI, code, images (SVG/png), etc.
