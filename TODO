As always, there is much to do...

- fix stock icon loading (image size versus usage in bars etc.)
- fix accelarators (HOW?)
- Let the item box behave the same way as the toolbox in GIMP.

- Define a proper scheme for flushing models. Currently a lot of elements
  have references around. This has to do with how PyGtk references python
  and C objects. We should do something like: clean all diagram items,
  then clean the rest of the elements in the ElementFactory.

- Activity: implement
	Add guards to ControlFlow
	FlowFinalNode (intermediate activities),
	ObjectFlow (if the arrow is connected to a ObjectNode),
	DecisionNode (/ MergeNode),

#- Class: Association end properties are shown in the tree view
- Undo/redo functionality doesn;t work as espected
#- Implement and test attribute/operation parser.
#- Convert Data model to use the parsed attributes + operations.
#- Operation is not part of namespace (assoc. should be bi-dir.)

- Make sure than, when a model is loaded and saved again, both save files do
  not differ.

- reordering of model elements doesn't work properly.

- Exporting diagrams to UML XMI, code, images (SVG/png), etc.

- Set up a plugin architecture. Since the internals of gaphor are pretty
  modular, plugins should not be that hard.

- Some nice icons.

More specific:
- Let commands determine if they are visible/sensible, instead of a
  has_capability function on the diagram item. This will be much easier with
  gtk+ 2.4.

  Classes have a makeup like this:
	+------------+
	|   <<st>>  o| stereotype: centered, icon: right justified.
	|  *class*   | class name, centered, bold
	+------------+
	|  *name*    | compartment name, centered, bold
	| + attr1    | attribute, operation or wharever
	+------------+
	| ...        |
	+------------+
- Create stereotype, so we can add them to classes.

- parsers for attributes, operations
- lose (not in a comment box) text
- make generator functions from load() and save()
