As always, there is much to do...

- Diagram items should be created for lots of model elements
  (we currently have Actor, UseCase, Comment and the fancy line that connects
   a comment with another model element). Also a buch of relationships are
   already implemented (Generalization, Include, Extend, Dependency).
   Next we should focus on the Association and then some static model elements
   like classes and packages.

- Exporting diagrams to UML XMI, code, images (SVG/png), etc.

- Set up a plugin architecture. Since the internals of gaphor are pretty
  modular, plugins should not be that hard.

- Text near lines (associations, dependencies, etc.). Not having this is a
  show-stopper...

More specific:
- Popup menu's: partially implemented, items which are not relevant for a
  specific model element should be hidden.
- Some logic about what classes can be connected to each other should be
  moved from the DiagramItems to the data elements.
- A more pattern driven design (using Factories, Singletons etc.). We're doing
  a pretty good job already, though...
- Add features to classes (attribute and operation).
