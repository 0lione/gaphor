> Gaphor is the simple modeling tool for UML.

![Gaphor Demo](docs/images/gaphor-demo.gif)

Gaphor is a simple and easy to use modeling tool for UML. It is aimed at
beginning modelers who want a simple and fast tool so that they can focus on
learning modeling of software and systems. It is not a full featured enterprise
tool.

## :scroll: Background

Gaphor was built to provide the foundational diagramming portions of
[Gaphor](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor). Since Gaphor is built on GTK+ and
cairo, [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/) provides access to the
GUI toolkit, and [PyCairo](https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/) to the 2D graphics
library. However, there wasn't a project that abstracted these technologies to
easily create a diagramming tool.

Here is how it works:
- Items (canvas items) can be added to a Canvas.
- The canvas maintains the tree structure (parent-child relationships between
  items).
- A constraint solver is used to maintain item constraints and inter-item
  constraints.
- The item (and user) should not be bothered with things like bounding-box
  calculations.
- Very modular: e.g. handle support could be swapped in and swapped out.
- Rendering using Cairo.

The main portions of the library include:
 - canvas - The main canvas class (container for Items).
 - items - Objects placed on a Canvas.
 - solver - A constraint solver to define the layout and connection of items.
 - view - Responsible for the calculation of bounding boxes which is stored in a quadtree data structure for fast access.
 - gtkview - A view to be used in GTK+ applications that interacts with users with tools.
 - painters - The workers used to paint items.
 - tools - Tools are used to handle user events (such as mouse movement and button presses).
 - aspects - Provides an intermediate step between tools and items.

## :floppy_disk: Install

To install Gaphor in Linux use Flatpak:

1. [Install Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/setup)
1. `flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`
1. `flatpak install --user org.gaphor.Gaphor`

We are currently working on installation packages for Windows and macOS. Until
that is ready, you can install  Gaphor, using pip:

```bash
$ pip install --pre gaphor
```

Use of a
[virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments)
is highly recommended.

### Development

To setup a development environment with Linux:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-gi python3-gi-cairo
    gir1.2-gtk-3.0 libgirepository1.0-dev libcairo2-dev
$ pip install poetry
$ poetry install
```
