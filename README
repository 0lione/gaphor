	Gaphor - A UML CASE tool.


Gaphor is rapidly becoming the first really usable CASE tool for GNOME (and
Linux in general).

Gaphor is written in Python, which makes it very easy to use (and
very easy to extend (and to write ;-).

In the file 'INSTALL' you'll find information about how to get this thing
started.

Have fun,
