	Gaphor - A UML CASE tool.


Gaphor is rapidly becoming the first really usable CASE tool for GNOME (and
Linux in general).

Gaphor is written in Python, which makes it very easy to use (and
very easy to extend (and to write ;-).

To get started do the following things:
- Get pygtk and gnome-python (the latest versions)
- Compile and install pygtk and gnome-python.
  (If you installed a packaged version of PyGTK (such as RPM's or .deb files)
   make sure you install the development packages too.)
- Get DiaCanvas2 and install it. If PyGTK is installed properly, it should
  be automatically detected by DiaCanvas2's configure script.
- do 'python setup.py config' to check if every thing is okay.
- Launch gaphor using the 'run' shell script.

Have fun,
