	Gaphor - A UML CASE tool.


This is to become a CASE tool what uses GNOME (GTK-2.0) for visualization.

Gaphor is mainly written in Python, which makes it very easy to use and
very easy to extend.

NOTE:	If you compile Gaphor yourself, you might want to patch your sources
	of PyGTK too. This will avoid reference leak (resulting in memory
	leaks) from objects referenced by a gtk.GenericTreeModel object.
	I know it is not a nice solution, but it makes things work as long
	as PyGTK itself does not solve the problem...
