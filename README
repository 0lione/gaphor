	Gaphor - A UML CASE tool.


Gaphor is rapidly becoming the first really usable CASE tool for GNOME (and
Linux in general).

Gaphor is written in Python, which makes it very easy to use (and
very easy to extend (and to write ;-).

To get started do the following things:
- Get pyorbit, pygtk and gnome-python (the latest versions)
- Compile and install pyorbit, pygtk and gnome-python.
- Get DiaCanvas2 and install it. If PyGTK is installed properly, it should
  be automatically detected by DiaCanvas2's configure script.
- do 'python setup.py config' to check if every thing is okay.
- Launch gaphor using the 'run-gaphor.sh' shell script.

Have fun,
