Gaphor - The Pythonic UML modeling tool
========================================

Gaphor is a UML modeling tool, written in Python. This makes it very easy to
use (and very easy to extend -- and to write ;-) ).

Install gaphor simply using easy-install:

  $ easy-install gaphor

In Linux recommend using a virtual environment for installation. Since pyGTK doesn't work well with a virtualenv,
install it outside the virtual environment and then start your the virtualenv using the --system-site-packages option:
  $ virtualenv --system-site-packages venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  $ easy_install gaphor

Have fun,
