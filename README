	Gaphor - A UML CASE tool.


Gaphor is rapidly becoming the first really usable CASE tool for GNOME (and
Linux in general).

Gaphor is written in Python, which makes it very easy to use (and
very easy to extend (and to write ;-).

To get started do the following things:
- Get pyorbit, pygtk and gnome-python (the latest versions)
- Compile and install pyorbit, pygtk and gnome-python.
- do './configure; make' in the Gaphor source directory.
- Launch gaphor using the 'gaphor.sh' shell script.
