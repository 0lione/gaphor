	Gaphor - A UML CASE tool.


Gaphor is rapidly becoming the first really usable CASE tool for GNOME (and
Linux in general).

Gaphor is written in Python, which makes it very easy to use and
very easy to extend.

To get started do the following things:
- Get orbit-python, pygtk and gnome-python.
- Patch the orbit-python sources with 'orbit-python-fix.patch'
- Compile and install orbit-python, pygtk and gnome-python.
- do './configure; make' in the Gaphor source directory.
- Launch gaphor using the 'gaphor.sh' shell script.

NOTE:	Gaphor is using Bonobo. For now the Python bindings for Bonobo
	rely on Orbit-Python. You would like to patch orbit-python with
	'orbit-python-fix.patch'. This will prevent gaphor from crashing when
	you close a window. I hop this patch will disappear as soon as the
	new Orbit bindings for Python are mature enough.
	If in doubt, please mail me.
