# Gaphor on Linux

Gaphor can be installed as Flatpak and AppImage on Linux, some distributions provide
packages. Check out the [Gaphor download page](https://gaphor.org/download.html#linux)
for details.

Older releases are available from [GitHub](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/releases).

[CI builds](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/actions/workflows/full-build.yml) are also available.

## Development Environment

To set up a development environment with Linux, you first need a fairly new
Linux distribution version. For example, the latest Ubuntu LTS or newer, Arch,
Debian Testing, SUSE Tumbleweed, or similar. Gaphor depends on newer versions of
GTK, and we don't test for backwards compatibility. You will also need the
latest stable version of Python. In order to get the latest stable version without
interfering with your system-wide Python version, we recommend that you install
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

Install the pyenv [prerequisites](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems)
first, and then install pyenv:

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Make sure you follow the instruction at the end of the installation
script to install the commands in your shell's rc file. Next install
the latest version of Python by executing:

```bash
pyenv install 3.x.x
```

Where 3.x.x is replaced by the latest stable version of Python (pyenv should let you tab-complete available versions).

Next install the Gaphor prerequisites by installing the gobject
introspection and cairo build dependencies, for example, in Ubuntu
execute:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-gi python3-gi-cairo
gir1.2-gtk-4.0 libgirepository1.0-dev libcairo2-dev libgtksourceview-5-dev
```

Install Poetry using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):
```bash
pipx install poetry
```

[Clone the
repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

```bash
cd gaphor
# activate latest python for this project
pyenv local 3.x.x # 3.x.x is the version you installed earlier
poetry env use 3.x # ensures poetry /consistently/ uses latest major release
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install
poetry run gaphor
```

## Create a Flatpak Package

The main method that Gaphor is packaged for Linux is with a Flatpak package.
[Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) is a software utility for software deployment
and package management for Linux. It offer a sandbox environment in which
users can run application software in isolation from the rest of the system.

We distribute the official Flatpak using [Flathub](https://flathub.org), and
building of the image is done at the [Gaphor Flathub
repository](https://github.com/flathub/org.gaphor.Gaphor).

1. [Install Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/setup)

1. Install flatpak-builder

       sudo apt-get install flatpak-builder

1. Install the GNOME SDK

       flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Sdk 42

1. Clone the Flathub repository and install the necessary SDK:

       git clone https://github.com/flathub/org.gaphor.Gaphor.git
       cd org.gaphor.Gaphor
       make setup

1. Build Gaphor Flatpak

       make

1. Install the Flatpak

       make install

## Create an AppImage Package

[AppImage](https://appimage.org/) is a format for distributing portable software
on Linux without needing superuser permissions to install the application. The
AppImage file is one executable which contains both Gaphor and Python. It allows
Gaphor to be run on any AppImage supported platform without installation or root
access.

We build our AppImage by first bundling Gaphor with PyInstaller and then
converting it in to an AppImage.

In order for the built AppImage to be compatible with older versions of Linux,
we build the release versions using Docker with an older LTS version of Ubuntu.

```Bash
poetry run poe package
cd _packaging/appimage
make dist
```
## Linux Distribution Packages

Examples of Gaphor and Gaphas RPM spec files can be found in [PLD
Linux](https://www.pld-linux.org/)
[repository](https://github.com/pld-linux/):

- https://github.com/pld-linux/python-gaphas
- https://github.com/pld-linux/gaphor

There is also an [Arch User Repository (AUR) for
Gaphor](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-gaphor) available for Arch
users.

Please, do not hesitate to contact us if you need help to create a Linux
package for Gaphor or Gaphas.
