# Gaphor on Windows

Gaphor can be installed as with our our installer.
Check out the [Gaphor download page](https://gaphor.org/download.html#windows)
for details.

Older releases are available from [GitHub](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/releases).

[CI builds](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/actions/workflows/full-build.yml) are also available.

## Development Environment

### Choco
We recommend using [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) as a package manager
in Windows.

To install it, open PowerShell as an administrator, then execute:

```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

To run local scripts in follow-on steps, also execute
`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. This allows for local PowerShell scripts
to run without signing, but still requires signing for remote scripts.

### Git
To setup a development environment in Windows first install
[Git](https://gitforwindows.org) by executing as an adminstrator:

```PowerShell
choco install git
```

### MSYS2
Both of the development environments in the next steps need MSYS2 installed.

Install [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/):

Keep PowerShell open as administrator and execute:
```PowerShell
choco install msys2
```

### GTK and Python with gvsbuild (recommended)
gvsbuild provides a Python script helps you build the GTK library stack for
Windows using Visual Studio. By compiling GTK with Visual Studio, we can then
use a standard Python development environment in Windows.

Note: gvsbuild says it requires msys2, but does it for our needs?

First we will install the gvsbuild dependencies:
1. Visual C++ build tools workload for Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools
1. Python

#### Install Visual Studio 2022
With your admin PowerShell terminal:

```PowerShell
choco install visualstudio2022-workload-vctools
```

#### Install the Latest Python

Download and install the latest version of Python:

1. Install from Chocolately with `choco install python` with admin PowerShell
1. Restart your PowerShell terminal as a normal user and check that `python --version` is correct.

#### Install gvsbuild

Open a new regular user PowerShell terminal and execute:

```PowerShell
mkdir C:\gtk-build\github
cd C:\gtk-build\github
git clone https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild.git

```

#### Build GTK

In the same PowerShell terminal, execute:

```PowerShell
cd C:\gtk-build\github\gvsbuild
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
pip install .
gvsbuild build --enable-gi --py-wheel gobject-introspection gtk4 pycairo pygobject gtksourceview5 libadwaita adwaita-icon-theme hicolor-icon-theme
```
Grab a coffee, the build will take a few minutes to complete.

#### Setup Gaphor

In the same PowerShell terminal, clone the repository:
```PowerShell
cd (to the location you want to put Gaphor)
git clone https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor.git
```

Install Poetry (you may want to consider installing poetry via [pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/), instead of pip):
```bash
PS > pip install --user poetry
PS > poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Install PyGObject and pycairo from gvsbuild
```PowerShell
PS > Get-ChildItem C:\gtk-build\build\x64\release\*\dist\*.whl | ForEach-Object -process { poetry run pip install $_ }
```

Install Gaphor's other dependencies
```PowerShell
PS > poetry install
```

Add GTK to your path:
```PowerShell
$env:Path = "C:\gtk-build\gtk\x64\release\bin;" + $env:Path
```

Launch Gaphor!
```PowerShell
PS > poetry run gaphor
```

### Debugging using Visual Studio Code

Start a new PowerShell terminal, and set current directory to the project folder:
```PowerShell
PS > cd (to the location you put gaphor)
```

Ensure that path environment variable is set:
```PowerShell
PS > $env:Path = "C:\gtk-build\gtk\x64\release\bin;" + $env:Path
```

Start Visual Studio Code:
```PowerShell
PS > code .
```

To start the debugger, execute the following steps:
1. Open `__main__.py` file from `gaphor` folder
2. Add a breakpoint on line `main(sys.argv)`
3. In the menu, select Run â†’ Start debugging
4. Choose Select module from the list
5. Enter `gaphor` as module name

Visual Studio Code will start the application in debug mode, and will stop at main.

## Packaging for Windows

In order to create an exe installation package for Windows, we utilize
[PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org) which analyzes Gaphor to find all the
dependencies and bundle them in to a single folder. We then use a custom bash
script that creates a Windows installer using
[NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) and a portable installer using
[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org). To install them, open PowerShell as an
administrator, then execute:

```PowerShell
choco install nsis 7zip
```

Then build your installer using:

```PowerShell
PS > poetry install --no-dev --extras poethepoet
PS > poetry build
PS > poetry run poe package
PS > poetry run poe win-installer
```
