# Coffee Machine: Concept Level

The concept level defines the problem we are trying to solve. For the espresso
machine, we are going to use diagrams at this abstraction level to answer questions like:

- Who will use the machine and what are their goals while using it?
- What sequence of events will a person take while operating the machine?
- What are the key features and capabilities required for the machine to perform its intended function?
- What are the design constraints and requirements that must be considered when designing the machine?
- What are the key performance metrics that the machine must meet in order to be considered successful?
- How will the machine fit into the larger context of the café, and how will it
  interact with other systems and components within the café?
- What are the needs of others like those marketing, selling, manufacturing, or buying the machine?

At this level, the focus is on understanding the big picture of the espresso
machine and its role within the café system. The answers to these questions will
help guide the design and development of the machine at the logical and
technology levels of abstraction.

## Use Case Diagram

First the ants work on the behavior of the system. Expand the Behavior package
in the Model Browser and double-click on the diagram named Use Cases.

A use case diagram is a type of visual representation used in systems
engineering to describe the functional requirements of a system, such as an
espresso machine. In the context of the espresso machine, a use case diagram
would be used to identify and define the different ways in which the machine
will be used by its users, such as the café staff and customers.

The diagram would typically include different "actors" or users, such as the
barista, the customer, and possibly a manager or maintenance technician. It
would also include different "use cases" or scenarios, which describe the
different actions that the users can take with the machine, such as placing an
order, making an espresso, or cleaning the machine.

The use case diagram helps to ensure that all the necessary functional
requirements of the espresso machine are identified and accounted for, and that
the system is designed to meet the needs of its users. It can also be used as a
communication tool between the different stakeholders involved in the
development of the machine, such as the ants and Cappuccino the cat.

The ants need your help updating the diagrams, so let's get started:

1. Double-click on the actor to pop up the rename dialog, and replace User with
   Barista.
2. Update the name of the oval Use Case from Use Case #1 to Brew espresso.
3. Update the name of the rectangle Block from Feature to Espresso Machine

A barista interacts with the espresso machine.
The barista is provided a simple interface with a few push buttons.

In this particular use case diagram, we have one actor named Barista and one
use case called Brew espresso, which is allocated to a block called Espresso
Machine. The actor, in this case, is a cat barista who interacts with the
system (an espresso machine) to accomplish a particular task, which is brewing
espresso.

The use case Brew espresso represents a specific functionality or action that
the system (the Espresso Machine block) can perform. It describes the steps or
interactions necessary to complete the task of brewing espresso, such as
selecting the appropriate settings, starting the brewing process, and stopping
the process once it's complete.

The use case diagram shows the relationship between the actor and the use case.
It is represented by an oval shape with the use case name inside and an
association with the actor. The association represents the interaction from the
actor to the use case.

As they worked, the ants encountered numerous challenges. They had to ensure
that the machine was safe, efficient, and easy to use, all while meeting the
unique needs of their feline client. But with their deep understanding of
systems engineering and their commitment to key principles and concepts, they
were able to overcome these challenges and design an exceptional espresso
machine.

In the end, Cappuccino was thrilled with the machine, which worked flawlessly
and was a big hit with his customers. He was so impressed with the ants' work
that he offered them a long-term contract to design all of his cafe's systems.
The ants were proud of their success, knowing that it was all thanks to their
expertise and deep understanding of systems engineering principles. They had
proven that, with the right tools and approach, anything is possible.
