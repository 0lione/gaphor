# Event System

The Generic library provides the `generic.event` module which is used to
implement the event system in Gaphor. This event system in Gaphor provides an
API to *subscribe* to events and to then *handle* those events so previously
subscribed *handlers* are being executed.

For more information about how the Generic library handles events see the
[Generic documentation](https://generic.readthedocs.io).
