# Coffee Machine: Summary

The Technology Level design uses a very similar approach as the Logical Level.
Work on the behavior, structure, and then the requirements. At this level, you
will now specify all the design details for how this specific espresso machine
will work. We'll leave this exercise up to you to do, and we would be glad to
have contributions of this design back in to this tutorial if you are
interested in getting involved in Gaphor.

As they worked, the ants encountered numerous challenges. They had to ensure
that the machine was safe, efficient, and easy to use, all while meeting the
unique needs of their feline client. But with their deep understanding of
systems engineering and their commitment to key principles and concepts, they
were able to overcome these challenges and design an exceptional espresso
machine.

In the end, Cappuccino was thrilled with the machine, which worked flawlessly
and was a big hit with his customers. He was so impressed with the ants' work
that he offered them a long-term contract to design all of his caf√©'s systems.
The ants were proud of their success, knowing that it was all thanks to their
expertise and deep understanding of systems engineering principles. They had
proven that, with the right tools and approach, anything is possible.
