Diagram items

Diagrams typically contain a diacanvas.Canvas. This Canvas contains a bunch of
items. Those items are one way or another related to some UML.Element.

In the UML module a class Presentation is defined. It defines the relation
between one Element and multiple Presentations.

In the UML module all relations between objects are presented as associations.

There are some conflicts that have to be resolved when using Presentation in
conjunction with diacanvas.CanvasItem:

Both classes have the methods connect(), disconnect() and emit(). This can
be resolved by creating a signal named 'subject' for the CanvasItem and 
enforcing the methods to be directed to the CanvasItem's ones.

Element.presentation connects to '__unlink__' of Presentation.subject.

Both connect() and disconnect() have a slightly different syntax:

CanvasItem:				Presentation:
connect('name', handler, *args)		connect(('name',..), handler, *args)
					connect('name', handler, *args)
disconnect(id)				disconnect(handler, *args)
emit('name', *args)			notify('name')
handler(*args, *user_args)		hanler('name', *user_args)
