Feel free to hack Gaphor. Patches are welcome.

Structure
=========

Gaphor contains the following modules:

UML
---
The UML module contains the UML 2.0 data model. This part is
quite stable and it is unlikely that code has to be changed
here.

diagram
-------
The diagram module contains items that can be placed in diagrams.
In most cases the classes NamedItem and Relationship can serve
as bases for your class.

ui
--
The user interface. This is where most of the work is.

misc
----
Some utility stuff, such as Actions and aspects are put in here.
