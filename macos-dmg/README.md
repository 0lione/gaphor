Gaphor Mac OS X application bundle builder
==========================================

This module is used to create OS X app bundles for Gaphor. Nothing secret.

GTK+ and friends should be installed in /usr/local, using [Homebrew][1].  This
script picks up those files, drops them in a bundle and changes the link
references.

As said, the binary parts have to be present on the system. The rest is done
with [pip][2] in a [venv][3].
